2.0.0
	Adoption by Linuxgurugamer of both DraggableAltimeter and DraggableNavball
	Merging of code
	Eliminated the reinitialization of the values every time the flight scene is entered
	Removal of extra Update() call due to the merging of the mods
		The altimeter Xpos needs to be constantly reset, KSP seems to always reset it to 0
		The navball Xpos doesn't need that, probably due to it now being movable in the game config

	Moved merged mod code/directories into new mod directory
